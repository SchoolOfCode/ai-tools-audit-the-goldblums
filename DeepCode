Bottleneck issue identified: Security Vulnerabilities in Code

As TechForge is responsible for holding sensitive customer data with there applications, if a security vulnerability were to be present within their codebase, this could lead to a breach or a data leak. Currently the team are identifying these vulnerablities manually, this is a challenge to upkeep within the fast paced environment and with the current static analysis tool set, some issues might be going unnoticed. 

Enter DeepCode (Part of Snyk)

What does it do:

Automatically fixes code quality issues and security vulnerabilities by analysing your code and applying the most suitable solutions.

DeepCode offers continuous AI-driven code reviews, detects vulnerabilities, logic flaws and potential issues with thirs-party libraries. 

It integrates directly with GithHub and automatically reviews pull request and scans repo's in real-time as code is written or updated for security flaws. Repositories can also be scanned manually or during scheduled scans depending on the setup within your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring regular monitoring of code for any emerging issues.

It is integrated with the developers IDE and analyses changes and flags issues as they occur, to ensure vulnerabilities are detected early in the devlopment process. 

How does it work:

Scans code to detect issues (e.g., bugs, security flaws).
Suggests multiple fixes based on machine learning models.
Ranks these fixes and applies the best one automatically.

Impact:
By proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in the development phase this improves the overall security of TechForgeâ€™s applications. This reduces the risk of security incidents, saves time spent on manual reviews, and ensures compliance with security standards.

A. Opportunity
DeepCode AI Fix automatically identifies and fixes security flaws and quality issues in code. It improves processes by reducing the manual effort required to review and repair code, making it faster to address vulnerabilities and implement best practices.
Automates the detection of code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and potential bugs.

B. Risk
There is a risk of the AI generating incorrect or syntactically flawed code. Developers must review AI-generated fixes to prevent breaking applications.
Some fixes may need manual review to avoid breaking code or introducing errors. 
Developers might become over-reliant on the tool, assuming their code is fully optimised without deeper manual checks.

C. Tangible Benefit
It saves time by automating bug fixes, enhances productivity, and reduces tech debt through quicker, secure fixes.
Tech debt happens when quick fixes or shortcuts are made during development to meet deadlines but can cause problems later, requiring additional time and resources to fix.

How DeepCode AI helps with tech debt:

It identifies these inefficient or risky pieces of code automatically and suggests secure, efficient improvements in real-time.

This reduces the long-term cost of refactoring and maintenance, preventing tech debt from piling up.

Cost Savings: Catching bugs early in development can prevent costly issues down the line.

Time Efficiency: Automates code review processes, reducing the burden on senior developers and freeing up their time.

Productivity Gains: Improves code quality and security proactively rather than reactively.

Data: Uses public open-source code for training, not customer data

Price
Free - For individual developers and small teams looking to stay secure as they build.Free forever $0
Team - For development teams looking to build security into their development process.Starting at $25 per month/product

D. Evaluation
The benefits outweigh the risks, making it a highly recommended tool for improving code quality and security particularly given TechForge's use of GitHub and the need for continuous code quality assurance.
