Bottleneck issue identified: Security Vulnerabilities in Code

As TechForge is responsible for holding sensitive customer data with there applications, if a security vulnerability were to be present within their codebase, this could lead to a breach or a data leak. Currently the team are identifying these vulnerablities manually, this is a challenge to upkeep within the fast paced environment and with the current static analysis tool set, some issues might be going unnoticed. 

Enter DeepCode (Part of Snyk)

What does it do:

Automatically fixes code quality issues and security vulnerabilities by analysing your code and applying the most suitable solutions.

DeepCode offers continuous AI-driven code reviews, detects vulnerabilities, logic flaws and potential issues with thirs-party libraries. 

It integrates directly with GithHub and automatically reviews pull request and scans repo's in real-time as code is written or updated for security flaws. Repositories can also be scanned manually or during scheduled scans depending on the setup within your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring regular monitoring of code for any emerging issues.

It is integrated with the developers IDE and analyses changes and flags issues as they occur, to ensure vulnerabilities are detected early in the devlopment process. 

How does it work:

Scans code to detect issues (e.g., bugs, security flaws).
Suggests multiple fixes based on machine learning models.
Ranks these fixes and applies the best one automatically.

Impact:
By proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in the development phase this improves the overall security of TechForge’s applications. This reduces the risk of security incidents, saves time spent on manual reviews, and ensures compliance with security standards.

A. Opportunity
DeepCode AI Fix automatically identifies and fixes security flaws and quality issues in code. It improves processes by reducing the manual effort required to review and repair code, making it faster to address vulnerabilities and implement best practices.
Automates the detection of code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and potential bugs.

B. Risk
There is a risk of the AI generating incorrect or syntactically flawed code. Developers must review AI-generated fixes to prevent breaking applications.
Some fixes may need manual review to avoid breaking code or introducing errors. 
Developers might become over-reliant on the tool, assuming their code is fully optimised without deeper manual checks.

C. Tangible Benefit
It saves time by automating bug fixes, enhances productivity, and reduces tech debt through quicker, secure fixes.
Tech debt happens when quick fixes or shortcuts are made during development to meet deadlines but can cause problems later, requiring additional time and resources to fix.

How DeepCode AI helps with tech debt:

It identifies these inefficient or risky pieces of code automatically and suggests secure, efficient improvements in real-time.

This reduces the long-term cost of refactoring and maintenance, preventing tech debt from piling up.

Cost Savings: Catching bugs early in development can prevent costly issues down the line.

Time Efficiency: Automates code review processes, reducing the burden on senior developers and freeing up their time.

Productivity Gains: Improves code quality and security proactively rather than reactively.

Data: Uses public open-source code for training, not customer data

Price
Free - For individual developers and small teams looking to stay secure as they build.Free forever $0
Team - For development teams looking to build security into their development process.Starting at $25 per month/product

D. Evaluation
The benefits outweigh the risks, making it a highly recommended tool for improving code quality and security particularly given TechForge's use of GitHub and the need for continuous code quality assurance.

Testim a product by Tricentis: https://www.testim.io/

Testim is the leading AI-powered test automation platform for custom web applications. Testim enables fast authoring of AI-stabilized UI and end-to-end tests.

Problem Solved: 
Reduces time spent on manual test creation, maintenance, and updates for front-end and back-end workflows.

Process Improvement: 
Integrates with Jest and Postman to enhance the automation of unit and API tests. It adapts tests based on changes in the application, making the testing process faster and more reliable.

Downsides: 
High upfront configuration and learning curve. The tool could generate false positives/negatives or miss critical edge cases.

Security Concerns: Automated test scripts could be misconfigured, which could lead to incomplete testing and unintentional bugs slipping through.


Benefits:
Cost Savings: Reduces manual effort required for writing and maintaining tests, lowering labor costs.
Time Efficiency: Can execute large test suites faster, improving the CI/CD pipeline speed.
Productivity Gains: Frees up QA and development teams to focus on more critical or complex testing scenarios.

Conclusion- 

Testim is a extremnly useful tool in devolpmment, allowing for seamless creation of edge cases, unit and other tests which can be automated to save time in the dev process.
Will allow for more freedom to focus on other areas of the code whilst also having the increased security of tests within the code.

However as with all Ai tools it would most likly require a developer to check the tests to make sure they are working correctly which can remove some of the speed.
We were reached out o by a company called TechForge that is a company with a strong focus on JS and react/next.js for
projects and libraries. There have been issues with the timeframes in handling the building of the frameworks, errors are
occuring in the structure of the folder system causing widespread and difficult to solve issues. Code is not being adequately tested
which is increasing the risk of faulty code.

Part 3: AI Tool

We were reached out o by a company called TechForge that is a company with a strong focus on JS and react/next.js for

////////v0-dev a Vercel AI tool for all your JS needs.//////

 • What problems does this tool solve?

- The tool offers Component Creation:creates individual React components or sets of related components for your program. 
   These include things like state management, hooks, and complex UI elements.
- Code Snippets: provides code snippets for various parts of your application, 
   such as routing logic, state management setups, API integrations, and the like which help with decreasing errors.
- File Structure Recommendations: Suggests and explains optimal file structures for React projects, 
   especially those using Next.js.
- Configuration Files: helps with configuration files like `package.json`, `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.
- Explanations and Guidance: provides detailed explanations on how to set up and structure a React app, 
   including best practices and modern approaches.
- offers boilerplate code for various web development scenarios, particularly for React and Next.js projects.

 • How can it improve current processes?
- simple text prompts generate code so you do not need to give the LLM prewritten code to generate a response saving time.
- currently TechForge struggles with issues with the code structure and v0's boilerplate system will save time 
 as it will be able to create common components, file structures etc.
- Automates code suggestions and refactoring during development, enhancing code quality and consistency 
  reducing errors caused by syntax. This acts as an added buffer to any pre-existing linting and formatiing support,
  meaning code with errors is being pushed further onto the pipeline lss often.


 • What are the potential downsides?

- Single File Focus: Code is generated one file at a time which can be a slow process for a large app. 
- multiple files cannot be created in a single prompt so prompts have to be repeated which costs time.
- No Direct File System Interaction: it can't directly create or modify files on your system. 
  However there is an extension for vscode so the LLM can be used within the vscode system without requring browser.
- No Continuous Build Process: No continuous build process or manage an ongoing development workflow.
  Each interaction is separate, so  app building would be step-by-step.
- Limited Context Retention: The LLM can refer back to your conversation, 
  it does not maintain your entire project structure across multiple queries.

 • Are there security or compliance concerns/risks?

 - There is a risk of faulty code or the software developer not understanding the code being suggested but using it regardless 
   which can introduce uncertainty and greater issues down the line.
- risk of code smell ie noticing a problem that may have some deeper issues - code that is not reviewed may risk deeper issues.
- There is always a risk of some outdated coding practice being recommended which can pose a security threat.
- The big issue with v0 is that it is react/js/next.js complaint and reliant so it is difficult to currently use outside of this framework.
 As such there may be risks of it not being applicable in future projects if the company shifts and moves away from a JS, React framework.

 Tangible Benefit:

- Vercel makes it clear that ''No data related to your usage of Vercel,
Vercel CLI or Vercel's deployment services is or will be used to train the models used by v0.''
This means your code is not at significant risk (however you should still avoid pasting code with security risks in an LLM).
- There is a free tier and a reasonably priced $20 tier.

Metrics to Consider:

 • Cost savings.: The big thing with Vercel v0 is this ability to create js projects and the code for them in a cost saving manner.
 This greatly reduces risk of syntax errors which means time is saved when trying to find bugslike this meaning money is saved.
 • Time efficiency: A preset framework means less time spent having to build said framework and less time debugging the framework.
 The developer can then focus on more complex or specific tasks without having to worry about the optimal structure of their code.
 •Productivity gains: v0's ability to explain the best options for your code can save time in terms of considering what is available on the market 
and what is best to apply to your JS code. As such you can simply 


 Final Thoughts:
 • Does the benefit outweigh the risk?
- The benefits outweigh the risks in terms of streamlining the structure and review of code.
- There are clear time saving, cost saving and produtivity supporting aspects which benefit any team.
- code snippets correction or quick error fixes means that time is saved.
- the JS focus of the model means that the answers are much more likely to be focused on JS issues.
 • Would you recommend adoption?
- I recommend the use of v0 as it would benefit consistent, productive work.
