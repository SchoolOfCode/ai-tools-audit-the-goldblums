1. AI-Powered Code Review: GitHub Copilot
A. Opportunity:

Problem Solved: Automates code suggestions and refactoring during development, enhancing code quality and consistency.
Process Improvement: GitHub Copilot integrates directly into VSCode and can assist developers by suggesting entire code snippets, 
reducing the time spent on boilerplate code or looking up language syntax.
B. Risk:

Downsides: Developers may become too reliant on the tool, which could reduce deep understanding of code. Additionally, Copilot might suggest insecure or suboptimal code if not carefully reviewed.
Security Concerns: Copilot pulls from publicly available codebases, which could lead to the suggestion of vulnerable or non-compliant code. It would require additional layers of code review.
C. Tangible Benefit:

Cost Savings: Can reduce time spent on debugging and developing code, allowing developers to focus on more complex tasks.
Time Efficiency: Developers may complete tasks faster due to AI-powered suggestions, significantly improving productivity.
Productivity Gains: Automated assistance in generating boilerplate code and algorithms that reduce manual coding efforts.
D. Evaluation:
