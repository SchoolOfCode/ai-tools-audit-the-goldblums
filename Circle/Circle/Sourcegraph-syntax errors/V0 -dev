Part 3: AI Tool

We were reached out o by a company called TechForge that is a company with a strong focus on JS and react/next.js for
projects and libraries. There have been issues with the timeframes in handling the building of the frameworks, errors are
occuring in the structure of the folder system causing widespread and difficult to solve issues. Code is not being adequately tested
which is increasing the risk of faulty code.

We, the 'Codeblums by the Goldblums' aka auditors present the ultimate solution: 

////////v0-dev a Vercel AI tool for all your JS needs.//////

 • What problems does this tool solve?

- The tool offers Component Creation:creates individual React components or sets of related components for your program. 
   These include things like state management, hooks, and complex UI elements.
- Code Snippets: provides code snippets for various parts of your application, 
   such as routing logic, state management setups, API integrations, and the like which help with decreasing errors.
- File Structure Recommendations: Suggests and explains optimal file structures for React projects, 
   especially those using Next.js.
- Configuration Files: helps with configuration files like `package.json`, `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.
- Explanations and Guidance: provides detailed explanations on how to set up and structure a React app, 
   including best practices and modern approaches.
- offers boilerplate code for various web development scenarios, particularly for React and Next.js projects.

 • How can it improve current processes?
- simple text prompts generate code so you do not need to give the LLM prewritten code to generate a response saving time.
- currently TechForge struggles with issues with the code structure and v0's boilerplate system will save time 
 as it will be able to create common components, file structures etc.
- Automates code suggestions and refactoring during development, enhancing code quality and consistency 
  reducing errors caused by syntax. This acts as an added buffer to any pre-existing linting and formatiing support,
  meaning code with errors is being pushed further onto the pipeline lss often.


 • What are the potential downsides?

- Single File Focus: Code is generated one file at a time which can be a slow process for a large app. 
- multiple files cannot be created in a single prompt so prompts have to be repeated which costs time.
- No Direct File System Interaction: it can't directly create or modify files on your system. 
  However there is an extension for vscode so the LLM can be used within the vscode system without requring browser.
- No Continuous Build Process: No continuous build process or manage an ongoing development workflow.
  Each interaction is separate, so  app building would be step-by-step.
- Limited Context Retention: The LLM can refer back to your conversation, 
  it does not maintain your entire project structure across multiple queries.

 • Are there security or compliance concerns/risks?

 - There is a risk of faulty code or the software developer not understanding the code being suggested but using it regardless 
   which can introduce uncertainty and greater issues down the line.
- risk of code smell ie noticing a problem that may have some deeper issues - code that is not reviewed may risk deeper issues.
- There is always a risk of some outdated coding practice being recommended which can pose a security threat.
- The big issue with v0 is that it is react/js/next.js complaint and reliant so it is difficult to currently use outside of this framework.
 As such there may be risks of it not being applicable in future projects if the company shifts and moves away from a JS, React framework.

 Tangible Benefit:

- Vercel makes it clear that ''No data related to your usage of Vercel,
Vercel CLI or Vercel's deployment services is or will be used to train the models used by v0.''
This means your code is not at significant risk (however you should still avoid pasting code with security risks in an LLM).
- There is a free tier and a reasonably priced $20 tier.

Metrics to Consider:

 • Cost savings.: The big thing with Vercel v0 is this ability to create js projects and the code for them in a cost saving manner.
 This greatly reduces risk of syntax errors which means time is saved when trying to find bugslike this meaning money is saved.
 • Time efficiency: A preset framework means less time spent having to build said framework and less time debugging the framework.
 The developer can then focus on more complex or specific tasks without having to worry about the optimal structure of their code.
 •Productivity gains: v0's ability to explain the best options for your code can save time in terms of considering what is available on the market 
and what is best to apply to your JS code. As such you can simply 


 Final Thoughts:
 • Does the benefit outweigh the risk?
- The benefits outweigh the risks in terms of streamlining the structure and review of code.
- There are clear time saving, cost saving and produtivity supporting aspects which benefit any team.
- code snippets correction or quick error fixes means that time is saved.
- the JS focus of the model means that the answers are much more likely to be focused on JS issues.
 • Would you recommend adoption?
- I recommend the use of v0 as it would benefit consistent, productive work.
